            <h4>About Me - The Short Story</h4>
            <p class="about"> I was initialized as a pure C++ programmer and believed there is nothing better than that. Then I reimplemented myself into a Python coder and somehow ended up as a Java backend developer. I am currently working as an application engineer in a multinational company that specializes in the trading of energy commodities. My background is in finance. I got a diploma in financial management and before I became a developer I used to trade futures on CME derivative exchanges. I am interested in art, sport, meditation, hi-tech, nature and everything in between.</p>
            <p class="about">I will use this website both as a blog and as a hub to some of my work (project or demos). This web is written from scratch in Python Flask, my favourite web-framework.</p>
