        <h2>About Me - The Long Story</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I am a self-taught programmer with a primary focus on Python and C/C++. I started to learn to code when I was daytrader on CME derivate exchange, as I wanted to automate some of my strategies.</p>
        
        <p>Over time I turned to code more and started dedicating more time to it. Compared to the markets, it had one huge advantage - it was deterministic. The markets are the opposite - they are chaotic. There is no rule of what works and what does not. No one tells you what is correct and what is not. I have been trading and working for very large brokerage companies, and everywhere it was the same. No one knows anything. Everyone is just guessing. This fact became much more clear when I built a random walk AOS - a system trading utterly randomly, disregarding market data and comparing its results to people who strictly followed a "properly tested trading plan". It showed up that the AOS had equal or better results. It was a terrifying news! </p>
                
        <p>Financial markets are extremely challenging environment, especially in short term intraday timeframes. For some reason I seem to like to challenge myself and so I will be forever somehow involved in it. Even thought I do not do fulltime daytrading anymore, I still keep an eye on it. When I was into it, I could not sleep without my daily dose of orderflow. I used to spend 10+ hours a day watching ticking charts. What a tremendous waste of time! I have coded several studies and trading systems in ACSIL C++, that allowed me to sort of step away from the screen. I plan to share some insights since there is virtually no information about this framework.<p>
    
        <p>Besides trading and coding, I enjoy yoga, meditation, ayurvedic therapy, and all these mystical things that are hidden inside. I am very attracted to Hindu scriptures (I have studied religion at Charles University by the way) and eastern mythology, in general, is something very close to me. In the future, I will definitely make some project devoted to it.</p>

        <p>Another of my passion is music. I always had a musical taste somehow different from the mainstream and have been collecting hard-to-find albums from my youth. I decided to build an online radio streamer dedicated to ambient which a very particular genre of electronic music. You can <a href="http://www.atma-fm.eu" target="_blank">have a listen to it here</a> if you want to undergo a unique form of sonic therapy.</p>
