    <p>I've started to write code as a hobby first. Here are some of the projects that I was working on for fun. Sometimes I create something just because I want to get in touch with a particular technology. That is essentially my way of learning new things or re-learning the old ones.</p>

        <h3 class="uk-card-title">AtmaFM - Underground Online Radio</h3>
        <p>I have always been a huge fan of music. Unfortunately, my musical taste is quite a peculiar one and so I always had a hard time finding a radio station that would fit my needs. That is why I had to build my own. This is a personal online radio station focused primarily on ambient & related genres. 
        <p>It is written in Python using Flask framework, running on Fedora Linux, streaming nonstop 24/7.</p>

            <h3 class="uk-card-title">Covid Tracker - Real-Time Data Visualisation for USA</h3>
            <p>The pandemic of Coronavirus has been a hot topic for quite some time. I did not really believe in all the stories and all the numbers. Moreover, when the USA started to report them. To build this Covid19 Tracker, I needed a reliable API with correct data. Fortunately, I have found on. </p>
            <p>It is written in Python Dash, a useful framework for browser-based data visualization. I like Dash, although it is quite a pain to style the HTML from within the Python code.</p>

        <h3 class="uk-card-title">SC ACSIL C++ Custom Studies for MySQL</h3>
        <p>Coding trading systems in Sierra Chart's ACSIL C++ framework is a terrible experience, especially after many 'upgrades' the Sierra Chart's engineering did. When you need to connect these to the MySQL database, it gets even worse. Here I put together a working example of a study that writes details of each entry into a database table. It is modular and can be used together with other studies or as part of a more complex trading system.</p>
        <p>Written in C++ ACSIL, on Windows using Visual Studio 17 and MySQL 8.</p>
